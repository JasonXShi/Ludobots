My fitness functions (in robot.py) finds the longest contiguous number of timesteps where all 6 legs of my hexapod robot are not in contact with the ground.

In my PHC, I am selecting for the greatest fitness value, which corresponds to the longest time in the air. I am trying to make my robot jump as high as possible, which you can see is successful in the YouTube video. 

Run search.py to see the results. (you may have to change python to python3, depending on your system)
